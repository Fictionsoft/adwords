                        <p>In our office, my business partner and I had a little green "cha ching" button that sat on one of

                                <p>We would stand up and walk over and press that button once every hour or so. It helped break up the monotonous of the day,
                                    allowed us to stretch our backs, and add a little excitement.</p>

                                <p>Anyway, after <b>we started implementing some of the Google Adwords strategies</b> you'll learn about in the Adwords Masterclass,
                                    we were walking over to that button and pressing it every 5, or so, minute...</p>

                                <p>And at that point, believe it or not, we were actually starting to get annoyed that we had to press this little button so frequently. <b><em>Haha...</em></b></p>
